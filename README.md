# grunt-modulefiles

Enables a project to split its files into a set of modules. A module's information is stored in a json file containing a
name for the module, the files it contains, and other modules it depends on. The module files can then be accumulated
into various configurations of included and excluded modules, which can be fed into other plugins
(e.g. grunt-contrib-concat) for packaging.

## Getting Started

This plugin requires Grunt `~0.4.1`

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the
[Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a
[Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with
that process, you may install this plugin with this command:

```shell
npm install grunt-modulefiles --save-dev
```

Once the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:

```javascript
grunt.loadNpmTasks("grunt-modulefiles");
```

## The "modulefiles" task

### Overview

In your project's Gruntfile, add a section named `modulefiles` to the data object passed into `grunt.initConfig()`.

```javascript
grunt.initConfig({
    modulefiles: {
        your_target: {
            options: {
                // Target-specific options go here.
            },
            src: []// Target-specific file lists go here.
        }
    }
});
```

The `modulefiles` task will look for json dependency files in your project matching the specified file pattern.
These json dependency files contain a name for the module, the files it contains, and other modules it depends on. The
included files and dependencies should all be listed in the order of their dependence. The files should be paths
relative to the dependency file. The dependency file itself, should be located within a directory representing the
module.

```json
{
    "moduleName": {
        "files": ["file1.js", "file2.js"],
        "dependencies": ["moduleA", "moduleB"]
    }
}

```

If you wish to place the dependency file in a location outside of the module, you can specify the `directory` property
indicating where the modules directory is, relative to the module file. This is useful if the module is pulled in via
NPM. In the following example the dependency file would be a sibling to the module's directory:

```json
{
    "moduleName": {
        "files": ["file1.js", "file2.js"],
        "dependencies": ["moduleA", "moduleB"],
        "directory": ["./moduleDirectory"]
    }
}

```

### Options

#### options.exclude

Type: `String or Array`
Default value: `[]`

Either an array or comma separated string listing the modules to be excluded from the set of dependencies.

#### options.include

Type: `String or Array`
Default value: `null`

Either an array or comma separated string listing the modules to be included in the set of dependencies.
If the value is falesy the entire set of modules, minus exclusions (see option.exclude), will be used.

### Output

An object containing arrays of all the files and directories returned from the task, is stored at the targets output
property.

```json5
{
    "files": [/*file paths*/],
    "dirs": [/*directory paths*/]
}
```

This can be accessed using either grunt.config.prop or "<%= modulefiles.targetName.output =>". (see:
[`grunt.config`](http://gruntjs.com/api/grunt.config))

```javascript
grunt.initConfig({
    modulefiles: {
        your_target: {
            src: ["**/*Dependencies.json"]
        }
    },
    // example passing in the files to the concat task
    concat: {
        all: {
            src: "<%= modulefiles.your_target.output.files %>",
            dest: "package.js"
        }
    }
});
```

### Usage Examples

#### Default Options

In this example the json dependency files are found by matching the src pattern. There are no include and exclude
options specified, so all of the modules found will be used. An array of all the files is stored in the
'modulefiles.all.output' config property.

```javascript
grunt.initConfig({
    modulefiles: {
        all: {
            src: ["**/*Dependencies.json"]
        }
    }
});
```

#### Custom Options

In this example modules "moduleA" and "moduleB" are included, but "moduleC" and
"moduleD" are excluded. The resulting set of files is stored at the "modulefiles.some.output" config property.

```javascript
grunt.initConfig({
    modulefiles: {
        some: {
            options: {
                exclude: ["moduleC", "moduleD"],
                include: "moduleA, moduleB"
            },
            src: ["**/*Dependencies.json"]
        }
    }
});
```

#### Set a relative path

In this example, "cwd" sets the root directory for locating the dependency files from. The returned paths for the source
files and directories will be relative to the new root directory.

```javascript
grunt.initConfig({
    modulefiles: {
        all: {
            cwd: "path/",
            src: ["**/*Dependencies.json"]
        }
    }
});
```

## Contributing

In lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style. Add unit tests for any new or changed
functionality. Lint and test your code using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/).

## Release History

### v0.4.0

* Module definitions can specify a `directory` property to indicated the module's directory location. This allows the
  module file to be placed outside of the module; which is useful, for example, when a module is pulled in via NPM.

### v0.3.1

* Improved linting.
* Published to NPM

### v0.2.1

* Added an "cwd" option to specify a path that all source files and directories can be relative to.

### v0.2.0

* Improved dependency handling. Now the dependencies section in a json dependency file can be specified as a string,
  array, or be left off completely.
* Files are relative to the json file. Instead of providing paths relative to the grunt file, file paths in the json
  dependency files are now relative to the json dependency file.

### v0.1.0
